# outlook2pdf
A bit of a hack I did to create structured PDFs from outlook emails on a mac.

This actually started on Entourage as a bit of a "Oh...really?" to Adobe who insisted that you couldn't create a structured PDF from an email message on a Mac.

Clearly they were wrong. It's a bit of a hack, as what it does is create an HTML file from the email and then opens that HTML file in Acrobat, but the end result is the same. 

If you actually read the code, you see the method for using this with PDFPen Pro from Smile, an excellent choice as well.
